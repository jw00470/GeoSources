<h2>Welcome to GeoSources! We hope you will find this learning platform useful!</h2> 
<h3>Why Use GeoSources?</h3>
<p>Our mission is to provide a platform where teachers can share lesson plans and resources that can 
be used for lessons. Since education in many school districts have distanced from textbooks, teachers
have had to find the majority of their resources online and create their own lessons.
For many teachers, this has taken planning time and sometimes personal money to achieve what they
want their students to learn. Together, we can use GeoSources to save time and money, and we can provide
meaningful learning to our students!</br> 
For students, the website has a variety of resources that can be used for studying,
supplemental resources for enrichment, and acquiring content knowledge. All lessons are standard-based to the Social Studies Georgia Standards of Excellence
for sixth grade. Sixth grade social studies explores Europe, Latin America, Canada, and Australia. When studying each region,
sixth grade students learn about the areas' geography, history, government, and economics.</br>
I encourage you to explore this website and see if you can find what you need! If you cannot find what you
need, our contact information can be found at the bottom of the page. Let us know what you need!</p>
